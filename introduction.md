# Welcome to Single-Page Applications with AngularJS!

Most tutorials on learning to build single-page
applications (SPAs) and AngularJS start off with an
empty slate and introduce you to the different types of
functionality that AngularJS allows you to use to
create SPAs.

This unit takes you on a slightly different journey.
Instead of starting with a blank slate and building a
trivial UI-only application, we will start with a
fully-functioning Web application that uses no
JavaScript and use AngularJS to transition it into a
SPA one step at a time.

To get the most out of this unit, you should know HTML
and JavaScript. This particular unit uses a Java-based
backend, so it'd be good to know that, too.

We'll start with a little history lesson to understand
how we got to where we are. Then, we'll dive into code
and start converting this multi-page application into
an AngularJS SPA one step at a time. We're going to
learn

* how to get an AngularJS **application** onto a page;
* about **components**, the building blocks of AngularJS
  SPAs;
* **data binding** to tie together our HTML and
  JavaScript;
* how to **write services**, the way we should access
  data from our components;
* **routing** to give the illusion of multiple pages
  in our single-page app;
* how to do fancy HTML **rendering of lists** and
  stuff;
* learn how to get components to **communicate** with
  one another; and
* more!

So, fire up your editor and let's get going!
