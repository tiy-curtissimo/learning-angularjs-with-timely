# More Data Services

You want that datas! You look at the list of API
controllers and mentally mark off the
`TimeEntriesApiController` from the list.

![timely - list of API controllers](https://tiy-corp-train.github.io/newline-media/learning-angular-with-timely/api-controllers.png)

You have two more API controllers that need data
services. You will

* create a data service to get information from the
  `ReportApiController`; and,
* create a data service to get and update client
  information through the `ClientsApiController`.

You should follow the same steps that you just used
to create the new data services.

1. Investigate the controller noting the mappings,
   parameters, and return values
1. Design a data service API
1. Implement it

You also decide that you may consult with your old
friend *instructor's name here* to see if they have
any other way to approach these tasks.
